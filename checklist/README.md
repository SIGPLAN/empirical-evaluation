## Empirical Evaluation Checklist

An up-to-date version of the SIGPLAN empirical evaluation checklist should always be available [here](checklist.pdf).

### Feedback

We welcome feedback and suggestions for the checklist.

### Reading and maintaining 

The checklist is maintained as a plain-text [yaml](http://yaml.org) file [here](checklist.yaml), and a series of figures which are mained as pdfs [here](figs/), but are sourced from [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sdSNQTRRvSTgCUO7S4_w2oeNVIbX_SqsJvX_A-XFJ5M/edit?usp=sharing) Google Presentation.

### Generating a pdf

A pdf can be generated from the yaml using [this script](genchecklist.py).   The script requires Python3 and the PyYAML package (`pip3 install PyYAML`).
