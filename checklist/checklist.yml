Although the results (0.5 & 2.0) are reciprocals, their distance from 1.0 on a linear scale is different by a factor of two (0.5 & 1.0), overstating the speedup. Therefore showing ratios (or percentages) greater than 1.0 (100%) and less than 1.0 (100%) on the same linear scale is visually misleading."
